REQUIRED LIBRARIES
==================

Please download these libraries to enable full functionality:

1. XLSX.js (REQUIRED for Excel file support)
   Download from: https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js
   Save as: lib/xlsx.full.min.js

2. Chart.js (OPTIONAL for visualizations)
   Download from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.1/dist/chart.umd.min.js
   Save as: lib/chart.min.js

The dashboard will work without Chart.js but charts won't be displayed.
Excel files require XLSX.js to function.
